# Disaster Relief Project Part 2

## Introduction

In the wake of the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, countless individuals were displaced, leaving them without shelter, food, or water. The aftermath presented significant challenges for rescue operations, particularly locating those needing assistance. With communication lines down and infrastructure severely damaged, the ability to quickly and accurately identify the locations of displaced persons became a critical priority.

This project builds on Part 1 to apply advanced classification methods to solve a data-mining problem: locating people who need help after Haitiâ€™s Earthquake in 2010. The project aims to find an algorithm that can efficiently and accurately search thousands of geo-referenced images to locate blue tarps and communicate their locations to rescue workers on the ground in time to provide food and water to those in need. This phase focuses on analyzing and validating results using holdout data.

## Data Summary

The dataset consists of high-resolution geo-referenced imagery collected from aircraft flying over the affected areas in Haiti. It includes the following variables:

- **Class**: A categorical variable with five categories describing land types (Vegetation, Soil, Rooftop, Non-Tarp, and Blue-Tarp).
- **Red, Green, Blue**: Numerical variables representing the intensity of each color in the image pixels for each land category.

### Key Insights:

1. **Class Distribution**:
   - Vegetation and soil dominate the dataset.
   - Blue tarps, critical for locating displaced persons, are relatively rare.
2. **Color Channel Characteristics**:
   - Blue tarps exhibit distinct high blue values, enabling their detection.
   - Vegetation has high green values.
   - Soil and rooftops show distinctive red and green values.
3. **Class Imbalance**:
   - Blue tarps' rarity poses challenges for training models to detect them accurately among other classes.
   - Techniques like resampling, class weighting, or synthetic data generation were applied to address imbalance.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing:
- Addressed missing values in the Red and Blue channels through imputation.
- Normalized color intensity values for consistency.
- Handled class imbalance using resampling techniques.

### Model Training and Evaluation:

1. **Models Used**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
   - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Random Forest
   - Penalized Logistic Regression (Elastic Net)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels

2. **Validation**:
   - 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model robustness.
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall (Sensitivity), F1 Score, ROC-AUC.

3. **Threshold Selection**:
   - Determined optimal classification thresholds using ROC curve analysis to maximize Youden's J statistic (Sensitivity + Specificity - 1).

### Tools and Libraries:
- **R Programming**:
  - `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization.
  - `pROC` for ROC curve analysis.
  - `GGally` for exploratory data analysis.
